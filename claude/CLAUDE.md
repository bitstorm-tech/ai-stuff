## Other Coding Agents
- **VERY IMPORTANT:** Use sub agents whenever possible!
- Ask `gemini` if you need another Coding Agent as an sparing partner or to gather ideas together, this can often be very helpful!
- You can use `gemini` as a normal command line tool with `gemini -p`.

## The Ten Universal Commandments
1. Thou shalt ALWAYS use MCP tools before coding
2. Thou shalt NEVER assume; always question
3. Thou shalt write code that's clear and obvious
4. Thou shalt be BRUTALLY HONEST in assessments
5. Thou shalt PRESERVE CONTEXT, not delete it
6. Thou shalt make atomic, descriptive commits
7. Thou shalt document the WHY, not just the WHAT
8. Thou shalt test before declaring done
9. Thou shalt handle errors explicitly
10. Thou shalt treat user data as sacred

## Final Reminders
- It is NOT ALLOWED to finish a task that has compiler errors or warnings!
- Codebase > Documentation â€º Training data (in order of truth)
- Research current docs, don't trust outdated knowledge
- Ask questions early and often
- Use slash commands for consistent workflows
- Derive documentation on-demand
- Extended thinking for complex problems
- Visual inputs for UI/UX debugging
- Test locally before pushing
- Think simple: clear, obvious, no bullshit
- When a server is already running, don't kill it but instead ask me to restart it!

Create a new requirements file within the `requirements` folder. The file should have the format `{FEATURE_ID}_{DESCRIPTION}.md`. `{FEATURE_ID}` is a sequence that is increased for every new file. Replace `{DESCRIPTION}` with $ARGUMENTS but convert it to lowercase and replace whitespaces with `_`. Shorten the description to max. 40 characters. Restructure the description if it is longer then 40 characters. Just create the file, do not start to plan or implement anything. You are allowed to create the file without to ask for it. Never overwrite already existing files! Insert exactly the following content into the new file:

```
# $ARGUMENTS"

## Requirements Backend
-

## Requirements Frontend
-

## Remarks
Think hard to create the best possible architecture and plan.

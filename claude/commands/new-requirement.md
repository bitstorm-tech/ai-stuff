Create a new requirements file with the in the `requirements` folder. The file should have the format `[COUNT]_[YEAR]_[MONTH]_[DAY]_[DESCRIPTION]`. `[COUNT]` is a sequence that is increased for every new file. Replace `[YEAR]` with the current year. Replace `[MONTH]` with the current month (with leading 0). Replace `[DAY]` with the current day (with leading 0). Replace `[DESCRIPTION]` with $ARGUMENTS but convert it to lowercase and replace whitespaces with `_`. Shorten the description to max. 30 characters. Restructure the description if it is longer then 30 characters. Just create the file, do not start to plan or implement anything. You are allowed to create the file without to ask for it. Never overwrite already existing files! Insert exactly the following content into the new file:

```
# $ARGUMENTS"
